> Polyglot language learning tools 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexjpaz-playground/polly.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexjpaz-playground/polly)

## Why

When learning a language apps like [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) or [Memrise](https://www.memrise.com/) are valuable tools to building vocubulrary and grammar. **Polly** takes one aspect of these tools, reciting a phrase, and allows a user to practice a phrase as many times as they want until they feel comfortable using it with a native speaker for further training.

## Where

You can see a [demo](https://alexjpaz-playground.github.io/polly) of the application at https://alexjpaz-playground.github.io/polly. It is also a [progressive web application](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) so you can add this to your home screen to get a native app feel.
